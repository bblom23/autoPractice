# hello-world
This is a testing repo!

I am learning how to use git and github!

Furthermore I will be using this Repo to store all the files I use for automation. The intention is for this to become my personal growth repo that can be showcased for my automation benchmarking. 

So far I have integrated two tests and am working on Page objects / Step definitions and feature files. I need to move some thing around first so it is all accordingly guidelines. When I have done this deploy I will look into 'refactoring' this so it is up-to-par.

Cheers!
